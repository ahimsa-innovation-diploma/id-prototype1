# Preparing a Pitch to the Administration

### Mission Statement
For developing a pitch one of the fundamental features that determine the
success of the pitch is the mission statement. A mission statement is a short passage
stating the purpose of your program/trip, the goal of your operation, and the impact
you want to make. An example of a mission statement is the seva mission statement
which says that its goal is: “To give students equal opportunities to experience
transformation by immersing themselves in other cultures through exchange and
service.” Make sure to keep your mission statement short, sweet, and concise so it
maintains the attention of the staff you’re pitching to. Express what this trip means to
you and your team and make your true passion apparent.
Your mission statement is basically going to guide the trajectory of your trip and
experience your going to build. In your pitch, whether it's to admin or your parents
you can always lead with your mission statement so that your goals are loud and
clear and to show that you're always leading with purpose.
### Solid Plan and Information
An incredibly important part of your pitch is making yourself sound like you
know what you’re talking about. Your general plan should be really solid, safe,
realistic, and passionate by the time you present it to staff members. If you don’t truly
know what you’re talking about, they won’t take you as seriously. A general plan
should consist of a sample itinerary, alternative ways to get d.lab credit, a core team,
potential teacher chaperones, a main goal, a solid mission statement, a reliable
organization, and plenty of research. What is the impact you want to have on
yourselves, on your peers, on the school, and on the world?

## How to make a pitch

This is how the pitch will work...

Once you and your core team feel like you have done a sufficient amount of
research and have a solid mission statement, communicate to the seva that you're
ready to start working on your pitch. Then we, along with mentors, will guide you in
the right direction and help create your pitch. Then we will schedule a date to pitch
your trip to Melissa and usually a few other staff members to get feedback and next
steps for your project. (They might not give you an instant yes but that is okay and
happens to everyone. This is not about instant gratification and it's gonna be a long
process with a lot of ups and downs and lessons but that's part of the reason why it's
worth it) Then you’ll probably go back to the drawing boards and figure out what
needs to be fixed and worked on before your next pitch and then you’ll set up the
next date for your pitch and present. But you might be asking yourself, what exactly
am I pitching? What will be in our pitch?...
There will be three main ideas/ itineraries that you will be presenting in your pitch:
1. One itinerary will be a trip that has already been created by a reliable
organization that d.tech has already partnered with in the past. This trip should
align with your mission statement and support the impact that you're trying to
make. Do some research on the service project or program that this
organization works with, understand what they are doing and why they are
doing it. Make sure that the service project is sustainable and if you don’t
know whether it is or not ask one of us from the seva. We want to do our best
as a seva to practice sustainable tourism and develop a better understanding
on what that means and how to participate in it.
2. The second itinerary should be with a new organization that you want to
partner with for the betterment of the seva and the school. Make sure that you
work alongside this company to create the trip that you want to create. Be
prepared to explain what this organization does and why, how does it practice
sustainable tourism and why you think a partnership with them would
improve your trip, the future of the school and the organization itself.
3. Last but not at all least, present an itinerary that you solely planned as a
group. Do a bunch of research, find the cheapest but safest plane tickets, call numerous organizations and see which one fits your mission the best. Call
different hostels and hotels and do research on the best places to stay in the
towns you’re staying in. Do research on local cuisine, local customs and
language. Maybe even when you're calling to ask questions, speak in their
native language! Present a fully planned itinerary at your pitch that is 100%
your group and what you want in a trip. If you think that the trip that you
planned best supports your mission statement all you have to think about is
safety and reliability. That can all be worked out, so if this is the route you
decide to take please come talk to the seva and we are more than happy to
help you solve the problem and figure out a third party to insure safety on
your trip. Make sure to do this step because even if this isn't the itinerary that
gets chosen in the end it's so important to know how to do the research and
have information about the place you're visiting and that you are developing
communication skills.

After you have presented all three itineraries your job is to argue to the admin
why one out of the three trips is the one that you choose, and why it best supports
your mission statement. Then have an ongoing conversation about which itinerary
the admin and your team think is best so that you can have next steps to work on
and a direction to go in.

Creating your itinerary is all about customizing it to make an impact and fulfill
the goals of your trip. You’ll want to do plenty of research prior to even making the
sample itinerary. You can learn about the culture, environment, customs, community,
landmarks, history, and more. You can then find activities and plan days with that
information in mind. Proving that you’ve researched a lot is important for convincing
the administration of your dedication and knowledge during your pitch. Having a
solid amount of knowledge on the area you’re staying in is not just important for
planning activities, but important for staying safe as well. You need to know and
understand your place as a tourist and respect the community you’re in. You are
entering the homes and communities of people with different cultures and customs.
It’s really important to treat them with respect based on **THEIR** definition of respect,
NOT yours. Hopefully, the organization you choose will be open to customizing and
creating the trip with you. If they are you can work together to make the best trip
possible for your group. You can take suggestions of activities and types of service
work (if you want to) from both the organization and your fellow team members. It
also helps to mention either each meal of the day or the times of each activity in
your itinerary just to get an idea of when each activity is going to take place. Your
sample itinerary should consist of a rough day by day layout of activities that you’re
going to be doing, in chronological order.
