# Picking a Reliable Organization
There are a lot of things to consider when choosing an organization to work
with. The organizations we have partnered with, listed down below, are not only
flexible in helping you create itineraries focused around your UN Sustainability Goal
-- they also share the same values as us and specialize in sustainable global service.
If you have chosen to complete your own research and find your own
organization to work with, there are a few things to keep in mind! The main aspects
to think about while finding a partner organization include their mission statement,
safety and concern for the students, credibility, project impact, and communication.
## Mission Statement
An organization’s mission statement is representative of what they believe in
and what impact they want to have on the world. Making sure the organization’s
mission statement matches up with their actions and projects is very important
because you want to make sure you are completing projects that have positive
impacts and are true. When or if researching your own organizations, asking yourself
these questions can help guide you:
- Are there any similarities between this organization’s mission statement and
d.tech’s?
- How have they put their mission statement into action?
- How does their mission statement align with or relate to my UN Sustainability
Goal?
## Safety + Concern for Students
Our #1 priority is the safety and wellbeing of the students going on service
trips. We want to ensure that the organization you partner with shares that same
value. Parents of the students going on trips are also immensely concerned for their
child’s safety, so knowing that their child is traveling with a safe and educated
organization will only benefit the trip. While researching organizations, be sure to
pinpoint any section they have on student safety and any actions they take to ensure
it.

## Credibility

Another important aspect of choosing an organization is their credibility. You
are traveling to another country around the world with this organization with your
peers and teachers -- you want to be able to trust them fully. Determining credibility
will take some deep research and time, but it is most definitely worth it knowing who
your organization is and what their history is. When researching their credibility, be
sure to look for
- Student and teacher reviews (good and bad)
- Don’t let one bad review determine your outlook on the organization. It’s
important to take into consideration all the factors, but do keep it in
mind.
- Advertisements
- See if their advertisements or videos they upload match the projects
they work on and the values they base themselves off of.
- How long they’ve been around/how much experience they have in
dealing with various situations
- Project Follow-Up (see Project Impact)

## Project Impact
Relating back to the organization’s mission statement and credibility, the
impact that your organization’s projects leave is incredibly important. In addition to
supporting your UN Sustainability Goal, you want to make sure they uphold their
own values and work closely with that country’s community members. Your
organization must understand the difference between voluntourism and
empowering the community to work towards a common goal. Be sure to research:
- Various projects they work on
- Which countries they are worked on in
- How they follow up/continue the positive impact
## Communication
You want to be able to communicate effectively with your organization to
ensure that logistics are being figured out and you’re both on the same page. When
first communicating with organizations, be sure to take down emails and phone


numbers and keep them in one place for easy access. There are going to be times
when you don’t speak with an organization rep for weeks or months, or times that
you need to go on an emergency call with them, so having any means of contact
with them will be helpful.
