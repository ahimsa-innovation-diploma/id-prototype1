# Equity

## What is Equity?
Equity, in definition, is the quality of being fair and impartial. A main goal of the
AHIMSA is to maintain equal opportunity for everyone, no matter your financial status.
Your parents aren’t going to pay for your expeditions, so don’t worry about not being
able to afford the trip. Our goal is to have each trip fundraise most, if not all, of its
money through fundraisers such as GoFundMe’s and potentially a big school based
travel fundraiser whose funds will be equally distributed amongst the trips. Some
students also got jobs to help support themselves for the trip, which was very
effective in helping reach fundraising goals on time.

## Money
“Money” is a word that tends to scare people off immediately and cause them
to dismiss your whole plan/project/trip right off the bat. People also often get
frightened right away by the term “travel” because they automatically assume they
cannot afford it. We want everyone to be fully aware of the fact that you do not need
to pay for the trip with money from your parents. As was mentioned before, the
money should be fundraised or earned through working, so everyone has an equal
chance financially. Also, this is a team effort. If one student falls behind and could
potentially not make a deadline, support each other. Let’s say that you are $1,000
short on money for your trip. If one of your fellow team members got extra money
and has passed their goal, then they can help you out by giving you some extra
money. If you can’t reach fundraising deadlines you can always ask for help from
fellow team members through loans or extra money.

## The Teired Support System
While running the program, we have been challenged to find effective ways
to ensure equity. Many students struggle to find people to reach out to when
fundraising for their trips. It's very difficult because it's all about connections. A huge
problem has been lack of resources for students from low socio-economic status.
Unfortunately out of 4 trips, 6 students have been unable to go on trips because of
reasons including, but not limited to:
- Enrollment to join a trip (entry fee of $200)
- Unable to make larger payment
- Collective organization
- Resources outside of school (outside connections, access to a job, etc)
- Lack of support for students in need of jobs, coaching, working through
fundraising troubles

One of the main values of AHIMSA is equity and we want to ensure that all
students have equal opportunity to go and experience international service work
and experiential learning regardless of their socio-economic status. From this issue
we have come up with the Tiered Support System as a solution. The Tiered Support
System is a financial aid application process based on family income using Free and
Reduced Lunch data and personal student need. It's split up into two tier levels:
- Level 1: getting started support: $200-350 (need some time until student gets
a job; does have accessibility to resources)
- Level 2: support based on family income: FRL; little to no access to resources.
Aid ranges from $400-$1500 based on urgency of need.
We will also put on a fundraiser in late May with the goal to raise aid for students.
The money that we raise we would contribute to the money d.tech would be
allocating to help aid the program. Hopefully, it becomes a AHIMSA tradition and helps
to insure equity for years to come. The idea is to raise money for the following year.
Fundraising Goal: $10,000
