# Equity

## What is Equity?
Equity, in definition, is the quality of being fair and impartial. A main goal of the
seva is to maintain equal opportunity for everyone, no matter your financial status.
Your parents aren’t going to pay for your expeditions, so don’t worry about not being
able to afford the trip. Our goal is to have each trip fundraise most, if not all, of its
money through fundraisers such as GoFundMe’s and potentially a big school based
travel fundraiser whose funds will be equally distributed amongst the trips. Some
students also got jobs to help support themselves for the trip, which was very
effective in helping reach fundraising goals on time.

## Money
“Money” is a word that tends to scare people off immediately and cause them
to dismiss your whole plan/project/trip right off the bat. People also often get
frightened right away by the term “travel” because they automatically assume they
cannot afford it. We want everyone to be fully aware of the fact that you do not need
to pay for the trip with money from your parents. As was mentioned before, the
money should be fundraised or earned through working, so everyone has an equal
chance financially. Also, this is a team effort. If one student falls behind and could
potentially not make a deadline, support each other. Let’s say that you are $1,000
short on money for your trip. If one of your fellow team members got extra money
and has passed their goal, then they can help you out by giving you some extra
money. If you can’t reach fundraising deadlines you can always ask for help from
fellow team members through loans or extra money.
