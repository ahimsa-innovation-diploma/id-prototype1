# Parent and Student Meetings

## Meeting Prior to Selection
Before the team members are chosen you’ll likely want to put on a meeting
for the parents of all the students that are interested in the trip. This will help the
parents understand the trip and it’s details so they can potentially decide in advance
whether they’re okay with letting their child go on the trip or not. Also, parents tend
to get confused and a bit worried when their child walks up to them and states,
“Hey! I want to go to ____ !” without much context or information besides that. It’ll
help inform the parents that this trip is actually happening and give them more
information to ensure their comfort (or discomfort) around the whole plan.
## How to Present
Without approval from the parents of the students going on the trip, your trip
simply can’t happen. That’s why it’s incredibly important to come off as professional,
put together/organized, and knowledgeable. You need to know what you’re talking
about and be confident in your answers, because if you aren’t it may make the
parents feel on edge. You’re bringing these students into new landscapes where
potentially dangerous situations can arise. You want to make sure the parents can
trust you to plan a safe and secure trip. If anything goes wrong they want to feel like
the issue can be handled quickly, strategically, and safely. If you show pure
confidence in your project then they’ll feel like they can relax a bit as well.
## What to Include in Slide Show
You’re going to want to make sure you have all the essential information
covered solidly in your slide show. This includes information about your organization,
visas, dates, locations, transportation, airfare, trip cost, extra costs, fundraising,
activities you’ll be doing there, impact you’ll make on the community,
motivation/inspiration for the trip, a full day by day itinerary, and more.
