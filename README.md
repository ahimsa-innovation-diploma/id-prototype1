# The AHIMSA Traveler's Guidebook

Welcome to the Design Tech High School AHIMSA Guidebook! This is a compilation of resources and information you’ll need for planning a trip through d.tech. Planning a trip via d.tech is a lot different than planning a typical vacation, so don’t underestimate the insanity. It’s important to stay positive and push through the frustration which will hopefully build resilience and drive in you. This is the main purpose of the guidebook, to help direct you through all of the obstacles you will face throughout this journey so you can plan a trip as efficiently and as thoughtfully as possible. This will be achieved through not just the guidebook as a resource but by mentorships with upperclassmen as well. This book will take you through all of the twists and turns that are prevalent in each step of the two-year plan and will hopefully help you conquer your goals and plan the most incredible service trip! Throughout 2017, 2018, and 2019 there were three d.tech trips executed. One being an exchange trip to Puerto Rico, another being a service trip to Fiji, and the other being a service trip to India. Each trip consisted of around 12-14 students who fundraised the money to make their trips happen. The students who traveled to India, Fiji, and Puerto Rico are incredibly passionate about travel and making it accessible to every student at d.tech. The students who experienced these life-changing trips, especially the core leaders, were strongly inspired by their terrific experiences and learning opportunities throughout this process. That’s why we encourage and hope for core leaders to become mentors after going on their trips. This helps people take what they’ve learned and pass it down to others to help more people successfully plan trips and experience meaningful moments. Over the past few years, sophomores, juniors, and seniors have been working to create AHIMSA, an equitable and supportive program where any student can have access to travel no matter their financial status. Students from these three trips have been taking on leadership roles as mentors for other students in hopes of supporting them throughout their trip-planning processes.
