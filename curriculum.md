# Pre-departure Curriculum

It is really important that each group has a deep understanding of where they are
about to go and what they might encounter. There are so many cultures around the
world and as students it is important to represent dtech with respect. This is a two
week curriculum outline (designed for dlab) so students have an opportunity to dive
deep into the culture they are about the experience first hand and what will be
expected of them during said experience. How you go about running this curriculum
is completely up to you but there are suggestions for some lessons.
* There are lesson plans for 9 of the 10 days. The extra day is there to help you
customize your curriculum.
## Day 1-2: Culture
Suggestion: divide topics evenly and spend the first day doing research and creating
short presentations. Use day two for presenting to the group and maybe follow it up
with a kahoot to make sure people are listening.

Population, Religion, Holidays (nice to know what holidays might be
