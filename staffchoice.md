# Choosing a Staff Member for your Trip

Choosing a good staff member is important to having a successful and
efficient trip. You need to make sure the staff member you choose has the
bandwidth and the time to help you with the trip. They need to be truly passionate
about what your trip is focused on, and they need to be able to go on the trip. Ideally
two staff members go on each trip, or more or fewer depending on the size of the
group. With some organizations, chaperones may be free to come on the trip, Rustic
Pathways is an example of this -- they don’t charge adults if they are accompanying
and taking care of a group of students. They don’t have to have traveled before, but
obviously they need to be comfortable taking a group of students somewhere, and
being responsible for what they need and what they students need before, and
during the trip. Being a staff member working on a trip is a large time and energy
commitment, as I’m sure anyone who has taken kids on a field trip would attest to.
The commitments increase with domestic and international travel in conjunction
with a school program.

Staff members on the trips aren’t teachers, or administration , they are
partaking in the same trip you are, they will be there for support, and in some
programs they will be leading alongside the leaders from your organization. They
will be working with you on whatever you are doing. Yes they will be in positions of
authority, but they are also travelers, d.tech representatives, and passionate people
with you. This may be the first time they have gone on this kind of trip. Everyone
needs to rely on each other, have a shared goal, and gain as much as possible from
the experience.

Something that may be blindingly obvious to some, but boggled the minds of
the first core group of the AHIMSA, is that not all the trips can go at the same time, for
the very simple reason that... we need teachers at the school. If there are 5-10 trips,
that is at most 20 teachers off campus, on these trips, that leaves very few to do the
whole teaching and running the school thing... oops. So when planning a trip, you
need to think about when you’re going and coordinate with other groups.
