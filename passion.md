# The Importance of Passion

Passionate students are what drive projects to success. When your core
group members give the project all they’ve got and genuinely care about the trip as
though it was their baby, that excitement and devotion will rub off on other team
members. You are all working on this for relatively similar reasons and therefore
share common goals. You’re all interested in immersing yourselves in the culture,
history, and customs of the places you’re visiting. How you present yourself at the
travel fair determines who you attract to your trip and can help collect a group of
students with similar mindsets, goals, and intentions. The different varieties of
service and activities you’re doing on your trip attract different types of students
based on their interests. For example, if your trip is more service focused and your
itinerary reflects that, then students that are interested in a service intensive program
will sign up for that in particular. It takes an insane amount of motivation to not give
up on your trip since the amount of hurdles you will need to jump throughout the
process is ridiculous. You will scream, cry, laugh, and run around in circles. At some
points it will feel like it isn’t worth it to continue, but you’ll later see that it definitely
was. You need to be prepared to work your butt off, but the journey is extraordinary.
### Is it worth it?
After all the hard work is done and your sitting with everyone of the plain all of
the stress and yelling will be worth it. Even though the trip will be incredible looking
back on everything you've done to make the trip happen will also be a great
experience. Your hard work has paid off and now you have the opportunity to have
the most transformational amazing experience that you created. You done good.
