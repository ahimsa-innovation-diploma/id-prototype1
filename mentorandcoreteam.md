# Mentor and Core Team

## What is a Mentor?

A mentor is an upperclassman who already has travel experience or is
interested in travel. They will have some sort of understanding of the two-year AHIMSA
plan and be passionate in helping other students have meaningful travel
experiences. They are students who can guide you in the right direction when a
group is lost in the planning process of their trip. They also should be the ones
keeping the core members of the group motivated and on track and helping with
communication between core members and administration. Communication is really
complicated when planning a trip and the mentor can help make sure that people
are on the same page and that core members are keeping everyone in the loop. A
mentor is also responsible for reminding students of deadlines, whether that's for
pitches or payments, and they can help plan core and team member meetings. It's
also important for mentors to give students inspiration and motivation for following
through with their trips and being the person that they can go to for support when
the planning process gets tedious or insanity ensues.

## What is a Teacher Mentor?

The role of a teacher mentor is very important in the success and organization
of a trip group. A teacher mentor is a staff member chosen by the students to help
organize fundraisers, organize regular check in meetings with the team, and make
sure that the students meet deadlines. They also help encourage the students to
stand up for themselves and work comfortably with core AHIMSA members and
administrators. They can also help look over pitches to make sure they cover all of
the bases and are informative and well researched. On top of that, which is
incredibly important, the teacher mentors discuss fundraising, financial concerns,
and any other worries that students might have one on one so core members don’t
have to. It isn’t acceptable for core members to bring up and discuss financial
matters one on one or in a group setting because they are still peers with the other
group members. So in a nutshell teacher mentors are there to help encourage core
members to lead confidently while also facilitating, making sure everything is on
track and organized.

## What is a Core Member?
A core member is someone (most likely a Freshman) who leads a travel
group. They should be the ones who take responsibility for their group or any
actions of the group. Core members are the main communicators and are
responsible for making sure that they are communicating properly and efficiently
with their group mentors and the team members on their trip. Core members are
also in charge of figuring out the main impact and goals of their trip and they have to
make sure those things are achieved. They are in charge of any pitches that the trip
has to do, logistics and itinerary. But the main purpose and most important job of the
core members is keeping their team members motivated throughout the entire
planning and trip process. You are a support system for your team and when you
need support you can look to your fellow core members. You would be taking on a
leadership role, and with that comes a time and energy commitment. As a core
member you should be passionate about the trip that you’re creating and be willing
to sacrifice some of your sanity for the benefit of your project.
Core members are the students who are the leaders of the team. These are
the people who will be working hard to make everything happen. They delegate
tasks to the rest of the group and are in charge of communication. They also are the
ones making sure that things get done efficiently and on time. They will act as
motivators for the rest of the group. They are usually the students who come up with
the initial idea and location, so it's their job to get people motivated and interested in
their trip. The core members will also be the ones in charge of communicating with
staff, AHIMSA, and the organization or program they will partner with for their trip.  
### How Do I Choose Core Members for My Trip?
It's important to find people who you can work efficiently and cooperatively
with for extensive periods of time. Amazing traits for this type of work are motivation,
dedication, collaboration, work ethic, common goals, similar interests, leadership,
empathy, and attentiveness. These skills end up being incredibly valuable because
without at least a handful of them people can lose interest and motivation in the
project, leaving you high and dry. In your first months of freshman year you will also
fill out an AHIMSA form that will help you identify your passions and values and hopefully
allow you to match with other peers that will want to work on a similar trip to you.
