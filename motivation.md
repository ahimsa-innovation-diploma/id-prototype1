One thing you will find along the way is yourself dragging your feet and
banging your head against the wall. But here are some methods to help keep you
going.
1. **Keep a constant log of all your goals** and separate between short term and
long term. This will be scary to look at but will help you prioritize one or two
tasks at a time which will feel much more manageable.
2. **Maintain constant communication with everyone.** This means staying in
touch with your mentors, organization, administration, seva leaders, and
fellow members regularly. Never underestimate the value of checking in with
people to see how they are doing.
3. **Have weekly, or bi-weekly meetings with the group, your teachers, and your
mentors.** These are crucial in being able to assure open communication and
cohesive group progress.

To keep moving is one thing but staying motivated is another. Anyone can
force themselves to follow through if they push hard enough but when you have a
sense of purpose it goes from pushing to being pulled. The most important thing
your group can do to stay motivated is taking the time to choose a place and or
sustainability goal you are all passionate about. It cannot be stressed enough that
if you don’t care about what or where or how the trip happens, this is not the trip for
you. Once you know the parameters of your service, start identifying some big
picture goals to help guide you throughout the process. These goals are less
about planning than they are about vision. This vision of what the trip should be will
help pull you towards your final goal.

As important as it is to set goals, stay on track, and be passionate, having fun
is just as important. Just because this project will be a lot of work doesn’t mean it
has to feel like it all the time. Giving the group space to relax, laugh, and get to know
each other will be incredibly valuable in the long run. Finding ways to make the work
itself engaging is crucial to staying positive and nowhere is it written that you are
expected not to have a good time. There will be days when things go wrong or
there’s an extra workload and they might not be fun but that is a great opportunity to
check in with each other and offer support. It is easy for people to lose interest
when they get frustrated but by taking on the challenges as a supportive group the
members will be much more engaged.
