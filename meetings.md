## Group Meetings

Frequent meetings and check-ins with your group are very important for
keeping everyone on the same page. You can schedule them on lab days, lunches,
or after school (if that works for your group). They’ll help everyone stay present in the
planning process and aware of each other’s needs, concerns, feelings, and ideas. It’s
really important to use this time as well to check up on how people’s fundraising is
coming along and how close they are to meeting their deadlines and financial goals.
In these meetings you can make announcements, remind people of upcoming
deadlines, check in on progress, and bond more as a group. You can also use this
time to get people excited and motivated about the trip and any upcoming events or
deadlines. It’s sometimes tough to get everyone to show up to the meetings so you
just need to make sure to remind the other team members and teachers numerous
times in person, through email, and over text.
## Open Communication
Maintaining open and consistent communication is crucial to the success of
your trip and group experience. Before diving in, try to create some channels and
get into the habit of using them
## Bonding With The Group
Developing a tight knit group of students is essential to creating a life
changing experience through the process of planning and going on the trip. You can
set goals for the trip, share your excitement, express your concerns, and create an
environment where everyone is on the same page about each other's feelings,
opinions, and goals for the trip. One of the main activities that will bring everyone
closer is putting on the fundraisers. That experience will help everyone learn to
trust, support, and be there for one another. You can also schedule bonding activities
outside of school such as beach days, movie nights and whatever fun activity that
will get your group closer together (maybe even Soulcycle!). Even the meetings can
be times where you can bond as a group. Your group can meet about what you
need to meet about and then spend the rest of the time just hanging out and getting
to know one another. Bonding before the trip is great but when you get on the trip
bonding with your group is pretty inevitable. Through your shared experiences and
memories with the people going on your trips you create close bonds and
friendships.
