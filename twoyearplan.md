## Year One
1. **Impact (Empathy & Research)**  
Impact is defined as the force of impression of one thing on another; a significant or
major effect. Before planning your trip, think about this question: what is the impact
you want to make? Are you wanting to make an impact on yourself, the students
going on the trip, the school, the world? What are the things you want to experience
or the people you want to meet that will leave a lasting impact on you or them? Take
a look at the United Nations sustainability goals and read about the ones that stand
out to you. This will help you think about the impact you want to make.
Once you have brainstormed some ideas of the kind of impact you want to make,
create a mission statement for your trip. Your mission statement should reflect the
impact you want to make and the trip you want to lead. This mission statement will
drive your research and planning. (Don't worry about coming up with a perfect
mission statement. You can always revise your mission statement later on if it doesn't
resonate with the impact you want to make.)
3. **Location & Dates**  
Where do you want to go? Thinking about the impact you want to make and the
mission statement you created, where in the world can that impact be made? The
next step is to brainstorm places you want to go based on your mission statement.
This may require some research to figure out where your mission statement and UN
sustainability goal(s) are most needed. Choose up to three different locations to dive
deep into research. When you have a few locations picked out, think about the best times of the year to
go to those particular locations. Think about the weather, safety, peak seasons for
tourists, etc. This is a great time to look at the Dtech calendar and work with AHIMSA
leaders and Dtech staff to figure out potential dates for your trip.
4. **Building your Core Team & Support from a Mentor**  
See the [Mentor & Core Team](mentorandcoreteam.html) section for more details. You may have started the planning process by yourself or with a few other people.
Before creating a pitch, it is important to figure out who the core members of your team are. Your trip should have around two to four core members (for innovation
diploma this may vary).

## Year Two
1. **Fundraising**
> See [Fundraising](fundraising.html) Section for More Information
● Plan for Large Fundraiser
● Delegate jobs amongst your team. (seva core team will give out larger jobs,
which you can delegate within your group. Figure out how much everyone
needs to fundraise. Communicate with other trips to figure out what they’re
working on.
● Working on Grants and Partnerships (optional) Start reaching out to potential
sponsors. Begin writing drafts of grants. Get help from mentors and teacher
mentors.
2. **Pre-departure Curriculum**
See Pre-departure Curriculum Section for more details.
Go over the Pre-departure Curriculum with your group members. Ensure that
everyone is preparing or prepared for your trip. Figure out any last-minute details
and send the final emails before your trip.
3. **Go on Trip!**
