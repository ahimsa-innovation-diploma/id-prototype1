# Fundraising

## General Fundraising Rules
No money can come from other students unless from a large fundraiser, or
through the koi pond.

Students are not allowed to have their parents pay for the trip.
This is seen as taking money that would have gone to d.tech, and this isn’t
something seva is allowed to do. All funding from large fundraisers will be
distributed equitably within the groups based on need and a criteria that has been
pre-decided by administration. d.tech is a school, so you need to document any
money given to the school for seva, so it can be put on record. d.tech is also very
particular about fundraising and has rules regarding what we can and can not do.
Fundraising can be difficult at d.tech, but it greatly determines how your trip plays
out. With adequate funding, you will be able to complete any activities and make
the most of your trip. Relating back to seva as a community, keep in mind you are
trying to make money for all of seva, not just yourself. Think of it as one large
organism and you are a part of it, helping, but also working towards your own goal,
your own trip, but everyone will work together to help everyone, and everyone will
benefit from this comradery.

## Smaller Scale Fundraisers/Ways to Raise Money
Having the money to go on your trip is vital. Without it, your trip will not
happen. Whether you are in the process of planning a trip or finalizing details, it is
never too early to begin planning out fundraisers and ways to raise money. Here are
some of the methods past trips have used to make money and finance their trip:
GoFundMe’s, Getting a Job and door to door pitches.

Getting money for your trip is really important, and while we don’t ask you to
pay any money, we do ask you to raise as much money as you can. Three previously
successful methods for getting the money you need for the trip are getting a job,
going door to door and setting up a GoFundMe. Getting a job can be hard, but there
are tons of resources around you to start making money and getting a head start on
the trip’s finance. In the past GoFundMe’s have raised around half of the money on
some trips. To make a good go fund me, you need to tell a personal story, make the
reader WANT to help you, tell them why you are going on the trip, what travel
means to you, and why you deserve to have someone give you money. Start with
your mission statement, what drives you, how hard you have been working on the
trip, and the reason you’re asking for money. Your story shouldn’t be that long, or
someone will lose interest in reading the whole thing, it should be medium length,
passionate, and personal. Some people's GoFundMe might not be as successful
however; this is where jobs come more into play. If you have a job it is a controlled,
lasting income that you can easily calculate how much time you need to work so
you can finance your trip. If you can’t find a job on your own, there are many sources
to help teenagers get jobs, they probably won’t pay well, but they will work when
making some money. Another Advantage to working is that, once you have gone on
your trip, you will have an easy way to get money, (Plus having a job looks good for
college applications). These are just two of the ways you can do your fundraising,
but they are very successful, and reliable as methods to get the money you need on
time.
## GoFundMe
GoFundMe’s tend to have a more far reaching component to them. They are
great if students can send the link out into their networks, or their parent’s networks,
which can help maximize the amount of money you make. Within your trip’s
GoFundMe, you should include your monetary goal as well as background on your
trip. Be sure to include where you will be going, your UN Sustainability Goal, and
why you are passionate about your service trip.
## Personal Financing
This includes getting a job. Your parents should not be paying for you to go on
this trip -- it goes against our core value of equity and isn’t fair to people in varying
financial situations. This also eliminates the need to involve the school and gets rid of
the regulations and restrictions that fundraising through Design Tech puts on you. In
our experience, it also creates a more laid back approach for yourself because you
are in control of when you make the money.
## Going door to door
Although a bit old-fashioned, going door-to-door was a method used by
seva’s first service trip: The India Service Trip. If you prepare a concise and proper
pitch, this can be a very efficient way of getting to know your community while
raising money. Below is a section prepared by Mr. Fenner.

### How to make a pitch for going door to door

Create a "pitch" like the SAMPLE BELOW:

(Background) When I (Mr. Fenner) used to knock on doors for a past job, I
spent a bunch of time memorizing my pitch and practicing it to myself, so that I'd
know how I look and sound. I even videotaped myself (I HATED watching it, since I
hated hearing my own voice), and learned a lot from watching myself what I wanted
to work on. When you practice, really try to notice how you are standing, what
you're doing with your hands and head, and how you are saying things. Practice
looking at the camera, to simulate being at someone's door and looking right at a
person.

Even better - practice "pitching" each other, and take turns being "difficult", or
"resistant" potential donors. Be respectful of their decision to not help, if that's the
case, but make sure you let them know that even small amounts will help you.
(*Keep an eye out for "No Solicitors" signs at houses, and don't knock at those - some
people get really angry if you ignore these signs.)

> SAMPLE PITCH  
Hi! My name is __________ and I'm a student at Design Tech High School, in Redwood Shores. 9 other students and I are planning a service trip to a community near
Patan, Bhutan, where we'll be helping improve sanitation for local residents. This
trip is really important to me because ________________. I really want to prove to
myself and my family that I can finance this trip on my own, so I'm here today asking you for financial help to make this trip a reality.
Here is a flyer showing the details of our trip. There is a website you can visit
to see our itinerary. If you'd like to take the flyer and look at the website before
donating, that's definitely ok! I've included a link to my personal GoFundMe page on
the flyer so it would be great if you could donate. I need to raise ____ dollars. Do you think
you'd be willing to support me in this project? It would be incredibly helpful if
you could support me with $20 / $40 / $50 / $80 / $100 / (Whatever you think
you should pitch your person at - gauging this takes practice)

- (IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE DIRECT AND ASK, BUT ALWAYS BE RESPECTFUL, AND
NOTICE if/when they start pushing back)
I would be incredibly appreciative of any amount you can donate. (If they
insist that they can't give the amount you proposed, remind them that... "Even $20
## BUMP-UPS - This is advanced territory!
- If you pitch someone for $20 and they don't bat an eye, they just say
something like "sure, we can do that!", YOU CAN GAUGE THE SITUATION AND
CONSIDER trying to "bump them up" and make a higher proposal.
> Example: "Wow! This means a lot to me - thank you. (Maybe consider asking - "Just curious, why are you interested in supporting this project?") I have a long fundraising road ahead of me, and am wondering, is there any way you could give $30 instead of $20? This small difference would have a huge impact on my chances of successfully raising funds for this trip."

**MOST IMPORTANTLY** - Practice on your own, and make it sound authentic - it
should sound like your voice. People can see through canned pitches, and you'll
have much more success if you practice your pitch and figure out how you can
deliver it to multiple different people in an authentic voice that you feel comfortable
with.
## Large fundraising event
(This can not in any way conflict with the d.tech fundraiser. I.E. off campus, with
mostly people not affiliated with the school, who wouldn’t have donated to the
school already) this would be a large group event, that everyone works together to
make happen.
## Off-Campus Bake Sales
This could be anywhere where it is legal to sell food -- look into getting a
permit to sell food, or go door to door. Bake sales on school campus can be a bit
tricky due to d.tech’s fundraising rules, but be sure to inquire with seva’s core
members when planning any fundraisers.
## Reach out to private organizations
Asking for them to sponsor your trip, if you have a cause you are trying to
empower, find someone who is doing the same, and ask for money from them.
Asking friends/ extended family for money. (You can’t ask anyone directly involved
with design tech because that may infringe on the Koi Pond.
Fundraising will be hard, but it is how you will actually go on the trip, and do
good in the communities you’re visiting, learn a new language, or partake in an
exchange program; it is the backbone of traveling realistically, you can’t go if you're
group hasn’t done the work so everyone can go, and everything is paid for. So make
sure everyone is doing their part, having fun, and you reach your end goal.


# Big Fundraiser

## What is it?
The big fundraiser is an event at school led by the trips within the seva and is
a way for each trip to obtain backup money. This is just in case some students fall
behind on fundraising and are having trouble reaching deadlines. There will be fun
events, activities, talks/speeches, food, music, raffles, and games decided on by
team members from all of the trips. All of the members from each trip would help
put on this big event by contributing to and working on different factors of the
fundraiser. It would also help each trip bond as a collective seva and hopefully
remove any sense of “every trip for itself”. This event brings together families,
community members, partners, and others who help us reach our goals.
## How does it ensure equity?
The most important goal with pulling off a big fundraiser is both helping trips
get a leg up financially and simultaneously achieving equity. This will be balanced
through making sure the students within each trip all do their fair share of work
when it comes to planning, designing, and conducting the fundraiser. We will make
sure that each trip gets an equal amount of money, and any variable/difference with
that (such as priority for certain trips with less fundraised money or a sooner
departure date) will be determined fairly by the administration. This fundraiser will
help support every trip as fairly and as equally as possible.
