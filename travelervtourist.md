# Traveler v.s. Tourist

## A Tourist Sticks Out and a Traveler Blends In
Tourists walk around with selfie sticks and tend to draw (sometimes negative)
attention to themselves. A traveler tries their best to blend in with the locals. They
look like they know where they are going (even if they don’t), they dress respectfully,
and they try their best to respect the social norms of where they are. Travelers come
into a new situation with a curious and educated perspective.
A Tourist Eats Comfort Food; a Traveler Tries out the Local Cuisine
A tourist will only stick to foods that they are familiar with, which sometimes
includes popular food chains. A traveler knows that food is the link to any culture.
They are willing to step out of their comfort zone to try out local dishes in order to
taste the country’s culture. Staying in your comfort zone is not the point of travel.
(This doesn’t mean doing anything that would make you uncomfortable but just that
it's important to test your limits when traveling, you will get a lot more out of the
experience if you do.
## A Tourist Sight Sees; a Traveler Converses with Locals
A tourist stays within their comfort zone and only sticks with seeing the main,
popular sights. They don’t really make an effort to go out and meet people except
those who they are traveling with. A traveler makes an effort to meet people from all
over. They try to talk with locals, find out the best (secret) things the city has to offer,
or discover unique stories that you can’t find in travel books. Travelers know that
locals are the best resource to use when exploring somewhere new.
## Tourist Stick to their Native Tongue; Travelers Make an Attempt to Learn the Local Language
Tourists will only speak their native tongue and make very little (if any at all)
effort to learn the local language. Travelers make an attempt to know at least a few
key words or phrases to use when traveling abroad. They know that learning how to
say simple things like “please”, “thank you”, and “hello” make much more of a
difference when traveling in a country that speaks a different language.
