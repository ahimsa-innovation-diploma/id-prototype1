# FAQs

## How should I pack?
Before going on your trip, you need to research the area beforehand. In
different cultures dressing certain ways is unacceptable and you need to be aware
of any other offensive actions. You should also be aware of what types of hygiene
options you will have, for example if you will be able to shower or do laundry. The
agency or group you go with will likely have a packing list you can use as a
reference tool for your group.
## How do I deal with jet lag?
There are many different ways of dealing with jet lag and not everything
works for every person. One way that we deal with jet lag is that even though we are
really tired, once we get to the destination, we stay up until it’s night time and then
go to bed (the common rule is not going to bed until 8:00 pm local time). This way,
you can wake up at the normal time and not be too jet lagged.
## How can I stay safe on your trip?
There are many things you should do to stay safe on your trip. First, do
research on things that aren’t acceptable in the area you're traveling to. Second, if
you are allergic to a certain kind of food, be sure to alert your organization prior to
departing for your trip. If you are allergic to something that’s not food, make sure you
try to stay away and also alert your organization. Finally, make sure to listen to your
chaperones because they are the ones trying to keep you safe. This is all stuff the
travel agency you use should touch base on, and if they haven’t, you shouldn’t be
traveling with them
## How do I stay motivated to plan a trip?
Make sure you're really passionate about your trip. If you are really passionate
about your trip, that will motivate you to want to finish working and go on the trip.
You really don’t need to focus on keeping motivated, just finding something that you
really want to be involved in and word on that. You won’t become bored if you are
really motivated to finish the trip. If you do find yourself being bored or unmotivated,
you just need to think about what you want to do on your trip, and the good you’ll be
doing. That should bring your mind back to it and help you keep driving.
## How can I figure out what I’m passionate about?
To find what you’re passionate about you should look into different trips that
have happened inside or outside of d.tech. Researching about different things that
you could do might spark interest and you can try and figure out how you could
make something like that possible.
## How do I ensure success?
To ensure success in planning your trip you should make sure that you keep a
timeline and schedule and stay on top of your work. If you’re working with a group
have weekly meetings and discuss what is going right and what isn’t working out.
## How can I create a good core group of students?
To create a good core group of students you need to find a group of people
that have similar interests in what you want your trip to be about and you want to
make sure these people will get the work done. Make sure that everyone agrees on
the same Ideas and is passionate about it.
